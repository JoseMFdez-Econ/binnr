Title: Scorecard modeling in R

Description: binnr is an R package that helps modelers build scorecards.
    Scorecard models need to be more than predictive. Regulatory oversight
    often necessitates they be transparent as well. Model transparency is
    difficult to enforce in more predictive, non-linear methods such as neural
    networks, random forest, or gradient boosted decision trees. Often direct
    modeler intervention is required to ensure proper treatment is given for
    values of independent variables. binnr makes it easy to do just that.
